<Prerequisites />

:::warning[Beta]
tsdevstack is currently in beta. [Request early access](mailto:hello@tsdevstack.dev?subject=Early access request) to get started.
:::

## Getting started

```bash
# Create a new project
npx @tsdevstack/cli init

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Templates

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `fullstack-auth` | Auth service + Next.js frontend with login/signup pages (Recommended) |
| `auth` | Auth service only (backend-only projects) |

We recommend `fullstack-auth` for most projects - it gives you a complete authentication system out of the box:

```bash
npx @tsdevstack/cli init --template fullstack-auth
```

### Project structure

After init, you'll have:

```
my-project/
├── apps/                       # Your services and frontends
├── packages/                   # Shared code
├── infrastructure/             # Terraform configs
├── .tsdevstack/                # Framework configuration
└── package.json
```

## Generate local configuration

Generate the configuration files needed for local development:

```bash
npx tsdevstack sync
```

This generates:
- Kong gateway configuration from your OpenAPI specs
- Secrets for local development
- Docker Compose configuration

## Start local environment

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Docker containers (database, Redis, Kong) and all your services with hot reload.

Your services are now available through the Kong gateway at `http://localhost:8000`.

## What's next?

- [Your First App](/getting-started/your-first-app) - Add a service
- [Project Structure](/getting-started/project-structure) - Understand the layout
- [Running Locally](/local-development/running-locally) - Local development workflow
